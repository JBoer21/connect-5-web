Need to: 

1. Determine what local storage variables are needed:
   - lastPlayedDate: to track when the user last played (COMPLETED - 2023-07-10)
     Implemented in useEffect hook in app/routes/_index.tsx
   - currentGameState: to store the current game progress (visible cards, attempts, etc.) (COMPLETED - 2023-07-10)
     Implemented as 'gameState' in localStorage in app/routes/_index.tsx
   - dailyScore: to save the user's score for the day (COMPLETED - 2023-07-11)
     Implemented as part of the gameState in localStorage
   - streakCount: to keep track of consecutive days played (COMPLETED - 2023-07-11)
     Implemented as 'daysInARow' and 'correctStreak' in localStorage
   - incorrectDays: to track the number of days with incorrect guesses (COMPLETED - 2023-07-12)
     Implemented in localStorage and updated in app/routes/_index.tsx
   - notPlayedDays: to track the number of days not played (COMPLETED - 2023-07-12)
     Implemented in localStorage and updated in app/routes/_index.tsx
   - attemptsDistribution: to store the distribution of attempts for correct guesses (COMPLETED - 2023-07-12)
     Implemented in localStorage and updated in app/routes/_index.tsx

2. Change frontend to display based on if game is played etc:
   - Add a conditional render to show different content based on hasPlayedToday state (COMPLETED - 2023-07-11)
     Implemented in app/routes/_index.tsx for both game in progress and completed game
   - If hasPlayedToday is true:
     - Display a summary of the day's game (team guessed, number of attempts) (COMPLETED - 2023-07-11)
       Implemented in CorrectDialog and IncorrectDialog components
     - Show a countdown or message for when the next game will be available (COMPLETED - 2023-07-12)
       Implemented in CorrectDialog and IncorrectDialog components
     - Optionally, display statistics (streak, average attempts, etc.) (COMPLETED - 2023-07-11)
       Implemented in CorrectDialog and IncorrectDialog components
   - If hasPlayedToday is false:
     - Show the current game interface (COMPLETED - 2023-07-10)
       Implemented in app/routes/_index.tsx
   - Implement a useEffect hook to check localStorage and set initial states (COMPLETED - 2023-07-10)
     Implemented in app/routes/_index.tsx
   - Update localStorage values when the game ends (whether won or lost) (COMPLETED - 2023-07-10)
     Implemented in handleSubmit function in app/routes/_index.tsx

3. Additional considerations:
   - Implement data persistence for partially completed games (COMPLETED - 2023-07-10)
     Implemented through localStorage in app/routes/_index.tsx
   - Add a reset function for testing or debugging purposes (COMPLETED - 2023-07-11)
     Implemented as clearLocalStorage function in app/routes/_index.tsx
   - Consider adding share functionality for users to share their daily results (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)
   - Implement separate dialogs for correct and incorrect guesses (COMPLETED - 2023-07-12)
     Created CorrectDialog and IncorrectDialog components

The issue with the gameState not being set correctly has been resolved.
