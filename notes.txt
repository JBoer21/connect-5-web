Need to: 

1. Determine what local storage variables are needed:
   - lastPlayedDate: to track when the user last played
   - currentGameState: to store the current game progress (visible cards, attempts, etc.)
   - dailyScore: to save the user's score for the day
   - streakCount: to keep track of consecutive days played

2. Change frontend to display based on if game is played etc:
   - Add a conditional render to show different content based on hasPlayedToday state
   - If hasPlayedToday is true:
     - Display a summary of the day's game (team guessed, number of attempts)
     - Show a countdown or message for when the next game will be available
     - Optionally, display statistics (streak, average attempts, etc.)
   - If hasPlayedToday is false:
     - Show the current game interface
   - Implement a useEffect hook to check localStorage and set initial states
   - Update localStorage values when the game ends (whether won or lost)

3. Additional considerations:
   - Implement data persistence for partially completed games
   - Add a reset function for testing or debugging purposes
   - Consider adding share functionality for users to share their daily results
