This was a game I played with my brothers growing up just out loud and always thought it would be cool to build it out. I had fun doing the data scraping and it really helped me get acquainted with Cursor when I first started using it as an IDE. Also I learnt a little about SEO and marketing and got to teach my younger siblings a little about web dev.
