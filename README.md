# Remix + Shadcn-ui Starter

A simple Remix + Shadcn-ui starter with an optimistic dark-mode based on [@kentcdodds's](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) [client-hints](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/client-hints/tree/main) library.

Why ?

I often reached out to implementing my own optimistic dark-mode logic every-single time I setup Shadcn-ui library, hence wanted to make this into a reusable repo that I and others can use it to quickly bootstrap a Remix starter.
